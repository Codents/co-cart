A REST API that handles the frontend of WooCommerce that’s Easy and Powerful.

== Description ==

### CoCart: The #1 REST API that handles the frontend of WooCommerce.

[CoCart](https://cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) handles the shopping cart in any modern framework of your choosing. No local storing required. Powerful and developer friendly ready to build your headless store, **without building an API**.

= Why should I use CoCart? =

The question is why not! WooCommerce's REST API is only created for store managers to control the backend of your store. So it's not the API you need to allow your customers to shop.

If you are wanting to build a headless WooCommerce store then CoCart is your solution.

With [the documentation](https://docs.cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) provided, you’ll learn how to enable the ability to add products to a cart and allow your customers to manage it in no time.

## Testimonials - Developers love it

CoCart, in my opinion, is the best frontend REST API for WooCommerce. Don’t just take my word for it though:

Amazing Plugin. I’m using it to create a react-native app with WooCommerce as back-end. This plugin is a life-saver! [Daniel Loureiro](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/amazing-plugin-1562/)

This plugin saved me tones of work and it is working amazingly! The plugin author provides fast and high quality support. Well done! [@codenroll](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-plugin-with-a-great-support-7/)

Thanks for doing such a great work with this! Works exactly as expected and CoCart seems to have a nice community around it. The founder seems really devoted and that’s one of the key things for a plugin like this to live on and get the right updates in the future. We just got ourselves the lifetime subscription. [Mighty Group Agency](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/awesome-plugin-4681/)

This plugin works great out of the box for adding products to the Woo cart via API. The code is solid and functionality is as expected, thanks Sebastien! [Scott Bolinger, Creator of Holler Box](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/works-great-out-of-the-box-16/)

#### Credits

This plugin is created by [Sébastien Dumont](https://sebastiendumont.com/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart).

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CoCart, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "CoCart" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
