Provides additional REST-API endpoints for WooCommerce to enable the ability to add, view, count, update and delete items from the cart.

== Description ==

WooCommerce REST API is great but it's missing one important endpoint that allows you to manage the cart.

That's were Cart REST API for WooCommerce comes in. It uses the Cart the same way Ajax requests are handled. Two added missing components to when viewing the cart contents are the product name and the main featured image URL which is normally requested after.

This saves time running additional requests.
