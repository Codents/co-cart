# WooCommerce Cart REST-API
Provides additional REST-API endpoints for WooCommerce to enable the ability to add, view, update and delete items from the cart.

> Development on this project has started but no testing has been done yet. Still have a few endpoints to create.

### Endpoints

This is how I see the endpoints. The **namespace** has been set to `wc/v2` to match with the current WooCommerce REST API version so when this API is used it does not confuse developers.

* View Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart```
* Clear Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/clear```
* Count Items in Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/count-items```
* Add Item to Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/add```
* Update Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/update```
* Remove Item from Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/remove/%cart_item_id%```
* Restore Item to Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/restore/%cart_item_id%```
* Update Item in Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/update/%cart_item_id%```
* Calculate Cart Totals - ```/wc/v2/cart/calculate-totals```

### To Do
