# WooCommerce Cart REST-API
Provides additional REST-API endpoints for WooCommerce to enable the ability to add, view, count, update and delete items from the cart.

> Development on this project has started. Yeah! :smile:

### Endpoints

This is how I see the endpoints. The **namespace** has been set to `wc/v2` to match with the current WooCommerce REST API version so when this API is used it does not confuse developers. It also registers before WooCommerce endpoints so the routes are in alphabetical order.

* View Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart``` - **TESTING**
* Clear Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/clear``` - **TESTING**
* Count Items in Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/count-items``` - **TESTING**
* Add Item to Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/add``` - **NEEDS TESTING**
* Update Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/update``` - **CALLBACK FUNCTION TO CREATE**
* Remove Item from Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/remove/%cart_item_id%``` - **CALLBACK FUNCTION TO CREATE**
* Restore Item to Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/restore/%cart_item_id%``` - **CALLBACK FUNCTION TO CREATE**
* Update Item in Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/update/%cart_item_id%``` - **CALLBACK FUNCTION TO CREATE**
* Calculate Cart Totals - ```/wc/v2/cart/calculate-totals``` - **CALLBACK FUNCTION TO CREATE**
