# WooCommerce Cart REST-API
An experimental feature plugin providing additional REST-API endpoints for WooCommerce to enable the ability to add items, view items, update items and delete items from the cart.

> Development on this project has not yet started.

### Endpoints

This is how I see the endpoints.

* View Cart - ```/v1/cart```
* Clear Cart - ```/v1/cart/clear```
* Update Cart - ```/v1/cart/update```
* Delete Item from Cart - ```/v1/cart/delete/%product_id%```
* Update Item in Cart - ```/v1/cart/update/%product_id%```
* Add Item to Cart - ```/v1/cart/add```

### To Do
* Create new endpoints.
* Validate each endpoint.
* Filters for product support.
* Create Storefront Child-Theme with REST-API supported for demonstration.

### Support Needed
* Subscription product types (WC Subscriptions & Subscribe All the Things)
* Bookings
* Product Bundles
* Composite Products
* Mix and Match Products
