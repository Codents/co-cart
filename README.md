## CoCart: The #1 REST API that handles the frontend of [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/).

[CoCart](https://cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=github.com&utm_source=repository&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) handles the shopping cart in any modern framework of your choosing.

## Testimonials

What can I say this thing has it all. It is the ‚ÄúMissing WooCommerce REST API plugin‚Äù without it I was managing users cart myself in weird and wonderful but hacky ways. NOT GOOD and so vulnerable. Then I stumbled upon CoCart and with the help of Seb I got it working how I needed it and he has been supporting me with even the smallest of queries. Really appreciate your work and continued support Seb.

This plugin was critical to achieve my project of building a headless / decoupled WooCommerce store. I wanted to provide my clients with a CMS to manage their store, but wanted to build the front-end in React. I was able to fetch content over the WooCommerce REST API, but otherwise would not have been able to fetch the cart, and add & remove items if not for this plugin.

Thank you very much S√©bastien for sharing this extension, you‚Äôve saved me a lot of time.

Thanks for doing such a great work with this! Works exactly as expected and CoCart seems to have a nice community around it. The founder seems really devoted and that‚Äôs one of the key things for a plugin like this to live on and get the right updates in the future. We just got ourselves the lifetime subscription.
