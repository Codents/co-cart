Provides additional REST-API endpoints for WooCommerce to enable the ability to add, view, count, update and delete items from the cart.

> This project is currently in development so please be aware that there may be bugs. [See bugs](https://github.com/seb86/WooCommerce-Cart-REST-API#bugs) on how to report.

### Endpoints

The **namespace** has been set to `wc/v2` to match with the current WooCommerce REST API version so when this API is used it does not confuse developers. It also registers before WooCommerce endpoints so the routes are in alphabetical order.

* View Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart``` - **TESTING**
* Clear Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/clear``` - **Complete**
* Count Items in Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/count-items``` - **TESTING**
* Add Item to Cart - ```/wc/v2/cart/add``` - **NEEDS TESTING**
* Calculate Cart Totals - ```/wc/v2/cart/calculate-totals``` - **Complete**
* Get Cart Totals - ```/wc/v2/cart/totals``` - **Complete**

The following are the same for ```/wc/v2/cart/%cart_item_id%```:
* Remove Item from Cart - **NEEDS TESTING**
