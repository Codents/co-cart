# WooCommerce Cart REST-API
An experimental feature plugin providing additional REST-API endpoints for WooCommerce to enable the ability to add items, view items, update items and delete items from the cart.

> Development on this project has not yet started. Will wait until WooCommerce 2.7 is finalized before proceeding.

### Endpoints

This is how I see the endpoints.

* View Cart - "/v1/cart"
* Clear Cart - "/v1/cart/clear"
* Update Cart - "/v1/cart/update"
* Delete Item from Cart - "/v1/cart/delete/%product_id%
* Update Item in Cart - "/v1/cart/update/%product_id%
* Add Item to Cart - "/v1/cart/add

Validation will be added after all endpoints work.

### Colloborate with Me

If you would like to colloborate on this project with me then tweet me [@sebd86](https://twitter.com/sebd86). Help from developers who developed extensions for new product types would also be a great help. :smile:
