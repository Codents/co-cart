## üîî Overview

A REST API designed to handle the frontend of your WooCommerce store. Control and manage the shopping cart in any framework of your choosing. Powerful and developer friendly, ready to build your headless store.

## Why should I use CoCart?

Well, even though the WooCommerce REST API is created with developers in mind, it‚Äôs only designed for controlling the backend of the store.

Most developers have to fork out further custom development to enable the frontend to meet their client‚Äôs specifications and that can be costly. CoCart provides that missing component to bridge üåâ the gap between your WooCommerce store and the app your building by enabling the features of the frontend at a fraction of the cost.

If you are wanting to build a headless WooCommerce store then CoCart is your solution.
