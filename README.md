Provides additional REST API endpoints for WooCommerce to enable the ability to add, view, count, update and delete items from the cart.


## üîî Overview

CoCart, also written as co-cart, is a REST API for WooCommerce. Accessing the cart via the REST API was highly requested by mobile and app developers and was missing from the core of WooCommerce.

So I built it. Tada!

It allows you to use WooCommerce‚Äôs REST API to its full potential providing the option to create a full web or mobile app üì± for your store powered by WooCommerce.


### Is This Free?

Yes, it's free. But here's what you should _really_ care about:

* The code adheres to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards) and follows best practices and conventions.

> At this time, none of the official WooCommerce library wrappers can be used with this REST API as they all require authentication which makes it difficult to use along with the other official REST API endpoints that WooCommerce provides.


### What's the Catch?

This is a non-commercial plugin. As such:

* Development time for it is effectively being donated and is, therefore, limited.
* Support inquiries may not be answered in a timely manner.
* Critical issues may not be resolved promptly.

If you have a customization/integration requirement then I'd love to [hear from you](mailto:mailme@sebastiendumont.com)!

Please understand that this repository is not a place to seek help with configuration-related issues. Use it to report bugs or propose improvements.

## ‚≠ê Support

CoCart is released freely and openly. Feedback or ideas and approaches to solving limitations in CoCart is greatly appreciated.

CoCart is not supported via the [WooCommerce Helpdesk](https://woocommerce.com/). As the plugin is not sold via WooCommerce.com, the support team at WooCommerce.com is not familiar with it and may not be able to assist.

At present, I **do not offer a dedicated, premium support channel** for CoCart but will soon. Please understand this is a non-commercial plugin. As such:

* Development time for it is effectively being donated and is, therefore, limited.
* Support inquiries may not be answered in a timely manner.
* Critical issues may not be resolved promptly.

#### üìù Reporting Issues

If you think you have found a bug in the plugin, a problem with the documentation, or want to see a new feature added, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues/new) and I will do my best to help you out.
