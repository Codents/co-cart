# Changelog for Cart REST API for WooCommerce

## v1.0.3
* Fixed: Syntax error for including cart controller for sites running versions of PHP lower than 7. Thanks to @Mr-AjayM for another contribution.
* Fixed: Validation of `cart_item_key` when removing, restoring or updating an item. Item keys starting with a letter were returning false. Reported by @Janie20.
* Tested up to WooCommerce v3.3.5 and up to WordPress v4.9.5

## v1.0.2
* Fixed: Invalid Argument Error should the cart be empty. Now returns "Cart is empty" properly. Thanks to @Mr-AjayM for the contribution.

## v1.0.1
* Added: Fetch current cart item data before it is updated.
* Added: New endpoint to restore, remove and update items in cart due to a conflict that prevented from registering the route.
* Corrected: Fetching cart item key as integer to a clean string.
* Corrected: Had response messages for updating quantity backwards. Oops!
* Improved: Made sure it returns a response if the cart is empty.
* Enhanced: Added a check to see if the cart has any items before calculating totals.

## v1.0.0
* Initial version.
